# standard-vagrantfile

This is a Vagrantfile, which is a configuration file used by Vagrant to create and manage virtual machines. 

The Vagrantfile contains instructions for Vagrant to configure and provision a virtual machine.

The file starts with a multiline shell script assigned to the variable $script. 

The script updates the system packages, installs Apache, MariaDB, Java JDK 11, Git, Ansible, Nginx, Terraform, Docker, and Jenkins.

Then, the Vagrant configuration begins with specifying the box that the virtual machine will use. In this case, it uses the "ubuntu/trusty64" box.

The Vagrantfile also includes commented-out sections for configuring port forwarding, private and public networking, and shared folders. 

Finally, the Vagrantfile uses the shell provisioner to execute the script defined in the $script variable.
